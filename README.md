## My process

Lay out all the HTML first to get all the elements put together. Working through comparing the design file and implementing the relevant CSS styles. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It is a lot harder to apply the knowledge I have learnt going through a tutorial to implementing it myself. I had to search around for help debugging why the layout for the flexbox was not applying correctly and positioning elements properly. But I have shown that I have learnt how to apply my HTML and CSS independently which I could not have done at all prior to the tutorials I completed.

### Continued development

Continue to work through the rest of the Frontend Mentor projects and see how it goes with applying my knowledge further.
